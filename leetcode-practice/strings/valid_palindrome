# For a given string s of length n, our task is to determine whether the string is a palindrome. A palindrome can have either an odd or even length.

# If the string has an odd length, we consider the center of the string as n // 2.

# If the string has an even length, the center lies between the two middle characters, so we initialize two pointers: left = n // 2 - 1 and right = n // 2.

# From the center, we use the two pointers to expand outwards: move the left pointer to the left (left - 1) and the right pointer to the right (right + 1) while the characters at both pointers are equal.

# If at any point the characters at the left and right pointers do not match, the string is not a palindrome. If we can expand the pointers to the ends of the string without mismatches, the string is a valid palindrome.

# This approach efficiently checks whether the entire string is a palindrome, handling both odd and even lengths correctly.
