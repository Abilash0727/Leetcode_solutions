# 1. Longest Substring Without Repeating CharactersGiven a string s, find the length of the longestsubstring without repeating characters.
# Input: s = "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with a length of 3.

        # Loop over the string with right pointer
        for right in range(len(s)):

                    left = last_seen[char] + 1

            # Update last seen index of the current character
