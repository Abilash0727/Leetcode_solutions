# This program checks if two strings are anagrams of each other.
# --------------------------------------------------------------
# What is an anagram?
# Two strings are called anagrams if they contain the same characters
# with the same frequency, but possibly in a different order.
# Example: "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.
